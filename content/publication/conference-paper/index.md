abstract: Térraba-Sierpe National Wetland (TSNW) is the largest wetland in Costa Rica
  located in the southeastern part of the country. The protected area comprises the 
  Térraba-Sierpe delta covered with dense mangrove vegetation. We aim to analyze 
  the geomorphological evolution of the coastal bars and the land use/cover change 
  between 1948 and 2012 using aerial photographs and satellite images interpretation 
  as well as field corroboration. We determined the geomorphological dynamics of
  three coastal bars (supratidal, intertidal, and subtidal), ten land uses/covers, and
  deforestation rates of six delta mouths for 64 years. In addition, we estimated a net
  periodic loss by deforestation between 1948 and 2012 exceeding 2562 ha, with an 
  annual net loss of 40 ha per year. Moreover, these outputs quantify the anthropic
  impact over 40 years and give good evidence from an example of environmental 
  policies implementation since the 1990s to protect these fragile tropical ecosystems.
